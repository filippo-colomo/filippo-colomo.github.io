The <a href="http://www3.unifi.it/dpfilo/CMpro-v-p-247.html">
Interdisciplinary Seminar on Philosophy and Physics</a>
is pleased to  announce the two-day meeting on
</font>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4">
"The Birth of String Theory"
</font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">
taking place in Florence, Italy, on May 18-19, 2007.
This event will be in connection with the program:
<a href="http://ggi-www.fi.infn.it/activities/workshops/stringM/stringM.html">
"String and M theory approaches to particle physics and cosmology"</a>
to be held at the Galileo Galilei Institute of Theoretical Physics,
Arcetri, Florence, from March 19, to June 22, 2007.
</font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">
In the two-day meeting, we shall go back to the birth 
of String Theory and recollect and discuss the ideas used 
at that time that led to the discovery and construction of the theory. 
We shall cover the period from the pre-history to the early developments,
corresponding to the years 1967-1981 approximately.
</font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">
The event is aimed at telling and reviving a remarkable series of inventions 
in theoretical physics that gradually revealed the powerful features 
of the theory. Contributions will be at the level of physics colloquia, 
and address a broad public of colleagues and students in physics and
history of physics.
